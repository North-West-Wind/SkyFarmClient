Client-side enhancements for Sky Farm.
This mod should meant to be used in Sky Farm only, but you can use it in other modpack if you want to.

[Here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sky-farm-client)'s its CurseForge page.

# Features
### Discord
- When launching Forge, your Discord will show a rich presence about mods loading.
- When loading is complete, your Discord will show a rich presence about how many mods are loaded.
- When entered a singleplayer world, your Discord will show a rich presence about you playing in a singleplayer world (in Sky Farm)
- When joined a server, your Discord will show a rich presence about you playing in a multiplayer server (of Sky Farm)

### Garden of Glass Skybox
Because Sky Farm does not use Garden of Glass generation, [Botania](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania "Botania") does not apply its amazing skybox.
When Botania is loaded together with this mod, you can enable the skybox.
If you would like to toggle it, use the command 
`/skybox <true | false>`

### Clear Skies
[Clear Skies Forge Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/clear-skies-forge-port "Clear Skies Forge Port") still haven't updated to 1.16.5, so I copied their code into this.

### No Horizon
Ever annoyed about the horizon below y=64?
This mod also removes the horizon, so your sky looks nicer.
If you would like to toggle it, use the command 
`/horizon <true | false>`
